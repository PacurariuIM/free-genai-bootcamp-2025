# Lang Portal


## Business Goal: 
A language learning school wants to build a prototype of learning portal which will act as three things:
- Inventory of possible vocabulary that can be learned
- Act as a  Learning record store (LRS), providing correct and wrong score on practice vocabulary
- A unified launchpad to launch different learning apps

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, SQLite3, Sequelize ORM
- Frontend: Typescript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN, Vite.js, React Router, Zod, React Query
- The API should be in JSON format
- There will be no authentication or authorization
- Everything will be treated as a single user
