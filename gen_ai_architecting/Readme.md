## Free GenAI Bootcamp

### Business Requirements

We aim to develop an application that can help foreigners learn faster German, to be able to pass the certification exams for intermediate level (B1, B2)

### Functional Requirements

Cost efficiency is key so we'll try to find the minimum required configuration to run this model, to be accessible for a large audience.

### Data Strategy

Data will be gathered from various sources readily available online.

### Model Selection and Development

The main method used for input-output will be text-to-text, but various other are taken into consideration (text-to-speech, images, etc). 

### Business Considerations

One of the challenges will be the high amount of data, considering the B2 certification requires knowledge of about 4-5000 words and the difficult German grammar.
